Complete this function such that it returns the median value from a list of numbers.

Remember, the median is the value at the center of the sorted dataset. 
If there are an even number of values in the dataset the median is the 
mean of the two center values.

# Very Simple Tests
assert median([]) == None

assert median([10,20]) == 15

# Add at least 3 more tests!
