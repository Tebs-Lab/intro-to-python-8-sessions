# There are MANY patterns to explore with "Object Oriented Programming" and you won't
# see all of them in this class. This example file does contain some common concepts 
# and patterns that you'll see, including:
#    composition (using objects within objects)
#    "state" and "behavior"
#    pythons "magic method" / "dunder method" system
