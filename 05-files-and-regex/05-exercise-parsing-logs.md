# Exercise: Parsing Logs with Regular Expressions

Use a regular expression — and possibly some additional supporting code — to answer the following questions about the Apache_2k.log file found in the `mock-logs` folder.

## The Questions:

* Count how many log entries were made during each minute (note that all entries occur the same hour in this logfile)
* Find all the distinct IP addresses that occur in the logs. (note, only IPv4 addresses occur in this log)
* Extract each unique error message
* Find the all ip addresses that occur in error entries, but do not occur in any non-error entries
