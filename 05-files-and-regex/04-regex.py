# Regular Expressions

# When working with text, especially when searching for patterns in text, regex is incredibly useful. Lets look at some of the basics.

# * Regex offers some very fancy features that can be very helpful...
#     * `.` is regex's version of `_` â€” it matches any one character.
#     * `*` and `+` are quantitative operations that modify the previous character:
#         * `.*` means "0 or more of any character"
#         * `.+` means "one or more of any character"
#         * `a+` means "one or more a's in a row"
#     * More specific quantitive operations use `{}`
#         * `a{1,3}` means between 1 and 3 a's in a row.
#         * The `?` can modify any other of these quantifiers to make it "greedy" which means it matches the shortest possible match. By default regex matches the longest possible match 
        
# * Character classes are grouped in `[]`
#     * A character class is a set of characters to match.
#     * The `-` is used to specify characters "between" each other, which has to do with the `ASCII` and `Unicode` formats and their lookup tables.
#     * But simply, `[a-z]` means all the lowercase letters from a to z. `[a-zA-Z] means all lower and uppercase letters.
#     * `[aeiou]` means any of the vowels. 
# * Character classes can be combined with the numerical operators!
    
# * `^` matches the start of a string and `$` matches the end of a string.
